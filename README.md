# Attack Sound Notifications
**Have you ever needed audible confirmation for the following:**
* Special attack hit
* Special attack miss
* Auto attack miss
* Max hit
* BGS maxed
* DWH missed (AGAIN)

Well this plugin may be of use to you then. You have the option to toggle notification sounds in the event those things happen!

## Custom Audio
### CURRENT:
Default audio is packed into the repo for the 5 times audio can be played.

To use custom audio:
1. Create a .wav file
2. Open the plugin panel
3. Click the second dropdown and select "Custom Audio" and select the file by either:
    * Enter the full filepath into the empty text box
    * Click the folder and select the file on your computer
    * **IMPORTANT** THE FILE MUST BE A .WAV FILE
4. Test the sound with the button
    * If the sound can't be found, a windows error sound will play

### Other
Ranged weapons have a different set of stuff to check for specs and their hits, so I'll probably have to look into that more too.
